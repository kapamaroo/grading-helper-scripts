This repo contains autograder scripts for the Autolab platform.

To create the needed files for say lab2:

1. Create lab2_conf.py with the configuration of the tests
2. Create tests_lab2 directory with the input / output of the testcases.
3. Run make LAB_NUM=2 clean autograde

   The generated files can be found in the autolab directory.

       autograde-Make LAB_NUM=2file  autograde.tar



To test locally the files:

4. Create lab2submit.tar.gz
5. Run make LAB_NUM=2 clean autograde test

The generated files can be found in the autolab/autograde directory.



Before you prepare another set of files for a different lab:

6. Run make LAB_NUM=2 clean
